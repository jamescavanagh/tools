To make it more difficult to get distracted,
I began to use the Iphone's screen time feature. 

However useful to track my time spent on my phone,
I found that after entering the password 2-3 times, I would
easily memorize it. Then, in violation of my integrity, I would
just enter the passcode every time I exceeded the limit 

So, I made a script that does two things, one is it makes it easier to
create a script that creates a password that is hard to type out.

Why make this more complicated than selecting a random number between 0-9999?

I found that many numbers are much easier to remember based on their
position on the key pad. Although this limits the number of passwords, 
it is not the main concern, because my phone already has a password, it
is to prevent myself from easily remembering it.
